#Final Project

Members – Frances Holland, Al Wagner, Lane Melton

Sources - Utilized AI to research converting dataset to TXT; Used Simon Kingaby's base code for creating a chat bot as well as Gradio code from exercises - https://github.com/simonkingaby/AI-BootCamp-Public/blob/main/Project%203%20Supplemental/Readme.md.

Implementation (25 points)
* A Jupyter notebook was created utilizing Google CoLab
* A dataset was identified – The Old Farmers Almanac, and randam articles from New York times.  Only Farmers Almanac was used for final version.
*The data was cleaned using a TXT converter PDF Plumber.
o Explain the Cleaning, Preprocessing and Transformation process – Utility Only - o Exported as a Natural Language Processing Application - *.TXT to Chat GPT.

* Explain how the Python script loaded a pretrained model – Utilized Chat GPT 3.5.  Natural language processing model.

* Must use two of the following:
o *scikit-learn 
o Keras 
o TensorFlow 
o Hugging Face ***
o spaCy or Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) 
o LangChain 
o *OpenAI******

* One additional library or technology NOT covered in class was - Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) 
o Whisper (OpenAI’s automatic speech recognition system) 
o DALL·E (OpenAI’s text-to-image model) 
o Other OpenAI capabilities, including: 
* Text-to-speech
* GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V)
* PyTorch
* Other
PineCone****
*PDF Plumber****

Model Optimization (25 points)
* Model optimization and evaluation was demonstrated showing iterative changes by - * The instructions were changed and made more specific for the model which resulted in a better answer outcome.
* The performance of the model is demonstrated when questions are presented to the Chat Bot concerning The Old Farmers Almanac and reasonable, understandable answers are returned.  

GitHub Documentation (25 points)
* The GitHub repository was created with only necessary files and clear documentation of what took place during the project.
* The README was customized into a polished presentation using Prezi.

Presentation Requirements (25 points)
The presentation includes the following:
* An executive summary or overview of the project and project goals.
* An overview of the data collection, cleanup, and exploration processes. *Include a description of how you evaluated the trained model(s) using testing data.
* 
Additional questions that surfaced, were……
	Would the questions be more accurately answered utilizing GPT 4.0?
	Would additional documents increase the accuracy of the dataset?
o Possible future development includes…
	Future development includes a mobile application.
	Increased dataset.
* 
A Results and Conclusions section was added to the presentation.
