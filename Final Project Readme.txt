#Final Project

Members – Frances Holland, Al Wagner, Lane Melton

Sources - Utilized AI to research convert dataset to TXT; Used Simon Kingaby's base code for creating a chat bot as well as Gradio code from exercises - https://github.com/simonkingaby/AI-BootCamp-Public/blob/main/Project%203%20Supplemental/Readme.md.

Implementation (25 points)
* A Jupyter notebook was created.
* A dataset was identified – The Old Farmers Almanac
* The data was cleaned using a TXT converter (name of TXT converter here)
o Explain the Cleaning, Preprocessing and Transformation process
o Exported as a Natural Language Processing Application
* Explain how the Python script trained and evaluated the model 

#OR

* Explain how the Python script loaded a pretrained model - 

* Must use two of the following:  (Which one was used?)
o scikit-learn 
o Keras 
o TensorFlow 
o Hugging Face 
o spaCy or Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) 
o LangChain 
o OpenAI
* One additional library or technology NOT covered in class was …
o Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) 
o Whisper (OpenAI’s automatic speech recognition system) 
o DALL·E (OpenAI’s text-to-image model) 
o Other OpenAI capabilities, including: 
* Text-to-speech
* GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V)
* PyTorch
* Other

Model Optimization (25 points)
* Model optimization and evaluation was demonstrated showing iterative changes by…
* These changes resulted in …
* The performance of the model is demonstrated when questions are presented to the Chat Bot concerning The Old Farmers Almanac and reasonable, understandable answers are returned.  

GitHub Documentation (25 points)
* The GitHub repository was created with only necessary files and clear documentation of what took place during the project.
* The README was customized into a polished presentation using Prezi.

Presentation Requirements (25 points)
The presentation includes the following:
* An executive summary or overview of the project and project goals.
* An overview of the data collection, cleanup, and exploration processes. Include a description of how you evaluated the trained model(s) using testing data.
* The approach that your group took to achieve the project goals.
* 
Additional questions that surfaced, were……
o Possible future development includes…
* 
A Results and Conclusions section
